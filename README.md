# Liri the Node App

## What Liri does
This node application allows you to pull information about movies, songs, and concerts with node.js.  

### How to use the app
In your bash/shell terminal, you can run `node` `command` `song/movie/artist` to get a result.

The available commands are: 
1. `spotify-this-song` and `song name` to get a result with information about the song and way to preview it.
2. `movie-this` and `movie name` to get information about the movie.
3. `concert-this` and `artist name` to get information about the next upcoming show.
4. `do-what-it-says` will run the command that is in the  `random.txt ` file.
